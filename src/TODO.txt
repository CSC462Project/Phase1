#TODO: Provide the linux binary for terraform as part of the submission
#TODO: Test the terraform binary on school servers


#NOTE: Terraform will work as a binary on linux.csc.uvic.ca, but needs Docker to create containers. I am not able
to install Docker, so we will need to think how this will work

Requirements:

Docker must be installed



Terraform is provided as binary, and will install packages in the working directory. However, this
 will require read/write permissions in the working directory.


 #TODO: Look into rm option in docker_container provider to see if we can auto shutdown containers when they are finished


 #TODO: find a way to build the source code before running the master process

 #TODO: Determine why connections timeout for worker containers when processing jobs
 #TODO: try to see if throwing more nodes at it fixes the problem
