Requirements:

 - Docker version 19 or above.
 - Ensure the Docker daemon is running

NOTE: This was unable to be tested on linux.csc.uvic.ca due to Docker not being/unable to be installed.

 - Golang 1.13

 - Terraform (either installed in binaries directory or provided locally)
 We will provide Linux binaries for Terraform for 32-bit and 64-bit systems in zip folders within the main project
 directory. However, the binary you will be using must be extracted and placed within the main project directory:

 PhaseI/src/

- Ensure you have full permissions enabled within project directory. Terraform will download dependencies and store them
locally, but have full permissions in the project directory to avoid any unexpected issues.


Guide:

Navigate to the Phase1/src/ directory.

Unzip the Terraform binary for your operating system or navigate to https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html to download
different binaries if needed.

    - In either case, the Terraform binary MUST be place within the PhaseI/src/ directory
